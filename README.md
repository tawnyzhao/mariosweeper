## About
This was written for a high school programming course, Programming 12. This was created to mimick the original WINMINE that was released with the Windows Entertainment Pack. However, there are some key gameplay differences between this version and original. 
* The timer starts at 0, not 1.
* Chording (double clicking/middle clicking) does NOT follow your mouse drag.  

## Features
There are a few extra features included.
* Music selection: choose from 6 soundtracks
* Change tile set: change the the mine image
* Detailed high score panel: view your recent games and average times
